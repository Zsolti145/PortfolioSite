                            <h2>Designing a glassmorphism layout</h2>
                            <p>Glassmorphism quickly became one of my favourite styles because it blends subtle gradients with
                                transparency. When I start a new design, I spend time defining a soft colour palette and a set of
                                layers that let the background shine through without sacrificing contrast.</p>
                            <p>To make the layout work on different screen sizes, I iterate with the browser&apos;s responsive tools and
                                move elements around until the composition feels balanced. The key is to lean on spacing, rounded
                                corners and blurred backgrounds so the card components stay readable even on a busy photo.</p>

                            <h2>My first portfolio</h2>
                            <p>My first portfolio was nothing more than a single page with a handful of screenshots, but it taught me
                                how important storytelling is. Each project needs context: the challenge, the process and the outcome.
                                I now prepare small write-ups before I even touch the code so that visitors understand the impact of the
                                work.</p>
                            <p>Version control, design systems and reusable components were all strangers to me back then. Revisiting
                                that old project motivated me to adopt better tools and to document the journey in posts like this one.</p>

                            <h2>Keeping accessibility in mind</h2>
                            <p>Accessibility is more than passing automated tests. I regularly review colour contrast, keyboard
                                navigation and semantic markup. For example, headings should form a clear hierarchy and links should
                                describe their destination&mdash;small details that make the experience smoother for everyone.</p>
                            <p>When writing content I try to avoid jargon, add descriptive alt texts and provide transcripts for
                                multimedia. These practices take extra time, yet they often surface improvements that benefit the entire
                                interface.</p>

                            <h2>From hobby to a career</h2>
                            <p>What began as a weekend hobby evolved into a full-time pursuit once I realised how much joy I get from
                                solving real problems for people. Sharing progress through this blog helped me connect with peers,
                                receive feedback and, eventually, open doors to new collaborations.</p>
                            <p>If you are on a similar path, keep experimenting and document your steps. The portfolio becomes a living
                                archive of your skills while the blog captures the lessons you learn along the way.</p>
